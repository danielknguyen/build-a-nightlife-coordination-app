  <li>As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.</li>
  <li>As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.</li>
  <li>As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.</li>
  <li>As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.</li>
